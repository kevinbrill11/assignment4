 * Critter description: Extremely aggressive critter that
 * lives fast and dies hard, just like Forrest Gump.
 * 
 * This critter is always running, just like Forrest Gump
 * 
 * The direction of the critter's movement is randomly selected
 * between either 0 or 4, just like how Forrest Gump ran from the 
 * west coast to the east coast.
 * 
 * This critter always fights
 * 
 * This critter will only reproduce if its energy is greater than 150,
 * and only once in its lifetime, just like Forrest Gump.
